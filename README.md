Investigate the impact of shutdowns within a water network. Select a pipe, find the isolation valves, the customers impacted, and any alternative supplies, all with one click.

[Epanet-js](https://github.com/modelcreate/epanet-js) is used to confirm the impact on the network and ensuring alternative supplies are adequate.

Only key information is displayed. Is there low or high pressure, and are there water quality issues to be aware of, such as velocity increases or flow reversals.

> **Try the app**: The app is deployed with a demo model at https://shutdown.modelcreate.com/
